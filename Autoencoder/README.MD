Autoencoder is an unsupervised learning which doesn't contain corresponding label and consists of encoder and decoder.

A MNIST still is applied.

autoencoder.py: a fully connected network and save autoencoder and encoder model, original.png is shown the enocder results.(here we use 2 dimension of encode layer for visible ploting.)

decoder.py: a fully connected network and save decoder model, training for a particular input like digit 4. The decoder model generates some examples automatically. (decoder_examples.png)
